# ROAD-ACCIDENT-DASHBOARD-
This document provides a structured approach to creating an Excel-based project report dashboard for effective project management. The dashboard enables users to monitor and visualize essential project metrics, such as task completion rate, budget utilization, resource allocation, milestone progress, risk status, and deadlines. It guides users through data organization, summary metric creation, and visualization techniques using charts and conditional formatting. Interactive controls, such as slicers and dropdowns, enhance the dashboard's usability, allowing stakeholders to filter and focus on specific data points. The result is a dynamic, user-friendly dashboard that supports data-driven decision-making, fosters transparency, and improves project oversight.
